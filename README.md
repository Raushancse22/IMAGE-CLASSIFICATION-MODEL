# TASK DESCRIPTION 

In this project, a deep learning-based image classification system was developed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model was trained and evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, such as airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

The task involved the following steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

CIFAR-10 dataset was loaded from TensorFlowâ€™s Keras API.

Data was normalized to improve training performance.

Model Building:

A sequential CNN model was created with multiple convolutional and max-pooling layers, followed by dense layers.

The architecture was designed to learn hierarchical image features for accurate classification.

Model Training:

The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss.

Accuracy was tracked on both training and validation data over multiple epochs.

Evaluation and Analysis:

Final accuracy was measured on the test set.

Performance was visualized using accuracy graphs.

A confusion matrix and classification report were generated for a detailed class-wise performance analysis.
